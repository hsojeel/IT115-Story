Once upon a time
There was a really handsome guy named Josh. He really liked the mobile game Clash of Clans.
Man is a god at it!
The man also enjoys long walks on the beach.
One day, he was going on his daily walk to beach and all of the sudden he is confronted by two little people.
They asked him if he wanted to do something strange for a piece of change. 
and josh said "hell nah", and started running away.
His friend Bill picked him up in the car to get away from the little people.
They manage to get away. 
Sometime later, Josh and Bill start hearing a bird call. Come to find out, it was their good ol' homie Beno.
They all group up and go on their journey back to Esau's house.
Then they all get kindapped by Victor and he uses them as his personal butlers. They are all ok with it.
The end.
